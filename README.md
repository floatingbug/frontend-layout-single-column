## Use cases

This single-column layout is designed for content-focused and marketing-oriented websites.
It emphasizes readability, clear visual hierarchy, and a linear user journey without secondary navigation columns.

Typical use cases include:

- **Landing pages**
  Product launches, marketing campaigns, and conversion-focused pages with a clear call-to-action.

- **Company websites**
  Small to medium-sized business websites where content is presented in sections rather than complex navigation structures.

- **Portfolios**
  Personal or professional portfolios that showcase work, skills, and experience in a clean and focused way.

- **Blogs and articles**
  Content-driven pages where readability and typography are more important than navigation density.

- **Product pages**
  Feature explanations, pricing pages, and product overviews with a guided scroll experience.

- **Documentation (simple)**
  Lightweight documentation or guides without the need for sidebars or complex table-of-contents navigation.

This layout is **not intended** for applications that require persistent navigation, dashboards, or complex user interaction patterns.
